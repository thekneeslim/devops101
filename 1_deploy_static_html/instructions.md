# Base Context
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language which is the standard language used for documents designed to be displayed on web browser. 

A sample HTML document can be found in this directory, titled `index.html`.

# Requirements: 

1. To deploy a static HTML page which a user can access
1. To create a Github repository
1. To document the steps you took for deployment
1. To include a flowchart / archetectural diagram indicating the AWS resources used and the relationship
1. Note down challenges, thought process & approach for this task

## Part (A)
* No automation is required

## Part (B)
* Automate whatever you have created in (A)
* CI/CD is out of scope 

## Part (C)
* Provision the resources via CI

# Alignment:
* Up to you to choose any resources, style, approach
* We should all use AWS
* No need to have a nice domain. The default AWS domain xyz123.aws.xxx.xxx is fine
